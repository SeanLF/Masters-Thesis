## Writing tools
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an online LaTeX rich text editor, similar to Google Docs.

## Analysis
To conduct our analysis, we ran statistical tests in Python and parsed our output files using Ruby. To generate the graphs, we used the Numbers app (Apple iWork) on MacOS, as well as a JavaScript library.
