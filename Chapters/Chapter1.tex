\section{Thesis Organization}

In chapter \ref{Chapter2} we review the background work surrounding data stream mining, ensemble learners, and concept drift detection.

Following the review, we will present the contributions made by this thesis to the literature in chapter \ref{Chapter3}.

As stated above, this will cover improvements to an existing concept drift algorithm to reduce its dependency on ground truth, improvements to a simple voting classifier to also further reduce its dependency on ground truth and finally a novel windowing technique that combines sliding and tumbling techniques.

In chapter \ref{Chapter4}, we will present the experimental designs for testing our improvements and present the results and discuss them in chapter \ref{Chapter5}.

Finally we conclude in chapter \ref{Chapter6}.
